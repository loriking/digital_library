# learning_library

This is a simple program. It's goal is humble. It aims to help me (and anyone else who is interested) keep track of resources (books, websites, videos, tutorials, etc.) I've used to learn something or build something. It's a type of project bibliograpy. 

**Usage cases** 
+ Upskilling. If you goal is to pass an exam you can create a list of all the internet sites, books, videos and podcases that you will use to achieve this goal. You can add new resources as you encounter them.
+ Imagine you spent all summer learning how to write interactive fiction in Ren'Py. A month later a friend of yours asks you what resources would you recommend you can just share your list. 

Implemented in python.

It is a work in progress.  

Motivated by a desire to become better organized and to develop code skills.
